language:C++

environment:open3D_0.10,  opencv3.4,  ASTRA SDK

In this project, ASTRA Depth Camera was used to collect colorImage and depthImage, and the point cloud coordinate data in camera coordinate system was obtained by calculating the internal parameters of the camera. Opencv34 and Open3D_0.10 were used for real-time 3D display.

Reconstruction using open3D is also included in the project, and data sets can be downloaded from the Redwood 3D open source dataset.
